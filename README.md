# ETHO-ENERGIES
### Reducing energy costs in homes through use of digital ethanol stoves

## PROBLEM
4 Million people die per year due to Household air pollution resulting from Biomass burning for cooking (Wood, dung, charcoal, and crop residue)

These Fuels are burned in simple stoves or open fires with ineficient combustion associated with the release of hazardous gases and particles such as carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. The arising pollutants are the major contributors to House Air pollution responsible for 2.93% of the deaths in Uganda each year

10kg of wood is used to make 1kg of charcoal resulting into annual wood consumption of 20 million tons to cater for the 96% Ugandans who use firewood and charcoal for domestic cooking

Deforestation leads to increased carbon dioxide and climate change.
Uganda alone estimated a loss of 49,200 hectares of tree cover (approximately 113 million trees) in 2021 due to deforestation, equivalent to 25.1 Metric tons (25,100 tons) of carbon dioxide emissions.

Women and children risk assault and sexual harassment daily when collecting firewood

## SOLUTION
Clean energy cooking through the use of Digital Ethanol stoves since Ethanol can be locally produced and is highly flammable with a blue non-luminous flame with a very low carbon emission rate lower than that recommended by the World Health Organization. Ethanol is safe, Efficient and Durable.

40% of fruits and vegetables go to waste along the supply chain which results in food wastage.

Currently, the annual post-harvest loss stands at 17.6% for about 2.8 million metric tons of maize (492,800 metric tons), 12.4% for about 214,000 metric tons of millet (26,536 metric tons), 13.5% of 230,000 metric tons of rice (31,050 metric tons) produced in the country. (Food and Agriculture Organization, SAVE FOOD; Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste Reduction).

This makes up a total of 550,386 metric tons of total waste from only these 3 crops which is enough to produce 242 billion liters of ethanol per year. 

If every Ugandan uses 10 liters of ethanol fuel for cooking, this Quantity produced can be enough for 47 million Ugandans for a year with an excess of 71 billion liters of ethanol. 

This ethanol can be used as an alternative fuel in cooking, vehicles, generators, and other machines like Popcorn machines, bricks burning machines, and slashing machines.

According to the Ministry of Energy, 2019, Uganda consumes 180 million liters of fuel per day, which makes the annual fuel consumption approximately 65.7 billion liters.

This implies that the ethanol produced from the annual harvest loss of only 3 crops (maize, millet, and rice) is enough to cater to the annual fuel consumption for the country including using it as a cooking alternative.

So the production of ethanol fuel involves the reduction of wastes from the environment including egg shells which contain calcium carbonate needed in Bio-ethanol fuel production.
