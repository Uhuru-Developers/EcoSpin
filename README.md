4 Million people die per year due to Household air pollution resulting from Biomass burning for cooking (Wood, dung, charcoal, and crop residue)

These Fuels are burned in simple stoves or open fires with ineficient combustion associated with the release of hazardous gases and particles such as carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. The arising pollutants are the major contributors to House Air pollution responsible for 2.93% of the deaths in Uganda each year

10kg of wood is used to make 1kg of charcoal resulting into annual wood consumption of 20 million tons to cater for the 96% Ugandans who use firewood and charcoal for domestic cooking

Deforestation leads to increased carbon dioxide and climate change.
Uganda alone estimated a loss of 49,200 hectares of tree cover (approximately 113 million trees) in 2021 due to deforestation, equivalent to 25.1 Metric tons (25,100 tons) of carbon dioxide emissions.

Women and children risk assault and sexual harassment daily when collecting firewood

Clean energy cooking through the use of Digital Ethanol stoves since Ethanol can be locally produced and is highly flammable with a blue non-luminous flame with a very low carbon emission rate lower than that recommended by the World Health Organization. Ethanol is safe, Efficient and Durable.


## THE PRODUCT
Currently, we have two prototypes of the system which are still under modification

### PROPOSED FEATURES OF THE STOVE
- Auto ignition to reduce lighting time
- Automatic switch off when the set time has reached
- Temperature adjustments through use of different temperature adjustment buttons
- Ability to use timing button, to make timings
- Display of energy (Ethanol fuel consumption) per week
- Auto low volume detection in the fuel tank and adjustment (increasing the volume) from the Reservoir.


## SUSTAINABILITY
![imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-7UM0VeKrMH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55960987/201831253-a57ad4a7-d7ba-4881-87b1-b4c30d081ad9.jpg)

40% of fruits and vegetables go to waste along the supply chain which results in food wastage.

Currently, the annual post-harvest loss stands at 17.6% for about 2.8 million metric tons of maize (492,800 metric tons), 12.4% for about 214,000 metric tons of millet (26,536 metric tons), 13.5% of 230,000 metric tons of rice (31,050 metric tons) produced in the country. (Food and Agriculture Organization, SAVE FOOD; Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste Reduction).

This makes up a total of 550,386 metric tons of total waste from only these 3 crops which is enough to produce 242 billion liters of ethanol per year. 

If every Ugandan uses 10 liters of ethanol fuel for cooking, this Quantity produced can be enough for 47 million Ugandans for a year with an excess of 71 billion liters of ethanol. 

According to the Ministry of Energy, 2019, Uganda consumes 180 million liters of fuel per day, which makes the annual fuel consumption approximately 65.7 billion liters.

This implies that the ethanol produced from the annual harvest loss of only 3 crops (maize, millet, and rice) is enough to cater to the annual fuel consumption for the country including using it as a cooking alternative.

So the production of ethanol fuel involves the reduction of wastes from the environment including egg shells which contain calcium carbonate needed in Bio-ethanol fuel production.


## COMPETITION
Access to cleaner fuels such as electricity and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) is limited due to logistical and financial supply barriers particularly high capital infrastructure costs, mostly in rural areas. 

Thus our target is to avail ethanol cooking fuel as well as Digital ethanol stoves in all parts of the country at the lowest possible price to cater to low-income earners. Stoves will also be purchased via hire purchase to enable payments in installments, and also the cooking fuel will be availed starting at as low as 1,000 Ugshs.
This ethanol can as well be used as an alternative fuel in cooking, vehicles, generators, and other machines like Popcorn machines, bricks burning machines, and slashing machines.


## BUSINESS PLAN

We intend to have an ethanol power plant with big tanks for the storage of ethanol

We plan to use the available trucks to carry crop waste (Rotten fruits and vegetables like Mangoes, yellow bananas, oranges, sugarcanes, and pineapples among others, food crops like maize, millet, rice, and potatoes among others, and food remaining like pineapple, sugarcane, and mango peelings) from farmers and markets centers to the ethanol plant for Ethanol production, as well as trucks carrying ethanol to market selling centers.

We will have a group of Ugandans involved in the production of Digital ethanol stoves and ethanol production

We will have refilling stations per local council for all areas where our stoves have been sold for easy access to cooking fuel


## PROJECTED POSITIVE IMPACTS
- Users will be in position to track their monthly fuel consumptions and also ethanol fuel willbe cheaper compared to Charcoal and Firewood
- Reduction in carbon emissions (carbon dioxide, soot, carbon monoxide, methane) by 30%
- Provision of employment opportunities to more than 1000 Ugandans who will be involved in stove production, ethanol production, and distribution as well as Marketing. 
- Reduction of waste by 40% since the waste will be recycled to produce ethanol, and the residue used as fertilizers.
- Reduction of Agricultural loss by 40% since the rotten agricultural materials will be used in ethanol production.
- Reduction in deforestation by 35%
- Reduction of cancer and other respiratory-related problems by 15%

### DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT
#### ETHO-GENERATORS: 
These are Generators that will use Ethanol to operate, to prevent the dangerous emissions made by Diesel or Petrol in Generators. This will as well reduce the operating costs of generators.


#### ETHO-CORNS: 
These are movable popcorn machines that will use Ethanol as their fuel instead of using Charcoal.


#### ETHO-GRILLERS: 
These will be ethanol stoves made particularly for meat grilling to replace charcoal stove grillers


#### ETHO-OVENS: 
So the-ovens will be made to replace charcoal and firewood ovens to be used in bakeries. These ovens will use Ethanol as fuel and will be made in such a way that they are cost-effective and safe compared to wood fuel ovens.


#### ETHO-SLASHERS: 
These are slashing machines that will be used for slashing in compounds and will be made in such a way that they use Ethanol fuel to operate and will be cost-effective.


#### ETHO-BRICKS: 
Currently, brick burning is one of the major source of pollutant gasses in the environment. Etho-bricks will be stoves designed in such away that they use ethanol to aid in brick burning. The stoves will be made in such a way that they are cost effective and can be hired by Brick layers to burn their bricks.


#### ETHO-VEHICLES: 
This will be a future project and research air which will reduce the fuel costs of running a car and reduce the dangerous gases emitted by Petrol and diesel to the atmosphere. It will involve cars which have an engine that runs on Ethanol.


## CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE THE PROJECT IS GOING TO EMPLOY
The project will employ both skilled (educated) and casual labor in the following categories;
- Stove Makers

- Industrial Chemists who will aid in Ethanol Production

- Mechanical Engineers who will aid in innovations like Ethanol generators, slashers, and vehicles among others

- I.T personnel who will be responsible for Digitalizing the system and monitoring the distribution and sales using advanced system

- Vehicle owners and drivers who will be distributing the stoves, transporting the raw materials, and distributing the fuel, among others
